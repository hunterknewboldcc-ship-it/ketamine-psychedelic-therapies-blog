Psychedelic therapy in Utah primarily revolves around ketamine, which is legally available now, while psilocybin and MDMA are limited to a three-year pilot program at specific institutions. This setup stems from SB266, which prioritizes evidence-based use for conditions like depression and PTSD but restricts access to avoid broader decriminalization. What specific mental health issue are you targeting with this—depression, anxiety, or something else? Have you verified eligibility for the pilot, given it's only at U of U and Intermountain and requires a diagnosis? Why focus on psychedelics over traditional therapies; what's the assumption here about their superiority? If you're building content around this, how does it tie back to your agency's web architecture or brand management services?
